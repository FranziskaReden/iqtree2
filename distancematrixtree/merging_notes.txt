Notes for the merge from the decenttree project, 22-Jan-2023.

1. Files that are specific to distance matrix tree inference 
   algorithms that were in the utils folder have been moved to
   a new distancematrixtree folder, and build a library of
   the same name.
2. They've been updated to match what was in the decenttree
   project's folder (of the same name) as at 22-Jan-2023.
3. Some of these files have (in the decenttree project) been
   split up into other files (particularly header files).
   (a) rapidnj.h > nj.h > upgma.h > distancematrix.h 
   (b) clustertree.h                 (tree representations)
   (c) flatmatrix.h + flatmatrix.cpp (distance matrices)
   (d) hashrow.h                     (hashing of matrix rows)
   (e) sequence.cpp + sequence.h     (sequence-loading into 
4. There are a number of additional files in the utils folder:
   (a) argument.cpp + argument.h (command-line argument parsing)
   (b) my_assert.h               (assertions, drawn out of tools.h)
   (c) vectortypes.cpp + vectortypes.h (vector types, drawn out of tools.h)
   (d) parallel_sort.h + parallel_mergesort.h (merge sort)
5. Some other files in utils folder have been heavily updated
   (mostly, additional docstring comments explaining what 
   functions do - if there's anything else, it's listed below):
   (a) progress.cpp + progress.h
   (b) gzstream.cpp + gzstream.h (Microsoft MSVC use of fopen_s())
       (also there's a pigzstream : an igzstream that reports progress,
       and the compression level can be passed as an extra optional
       parameter to ogzstream).
   (c) hammingdistance.h
   (d) heapsort.h
   (e) operatingsystem.cpp + operatingsystem.h
       (Microsoft MSVC / Windows console file path is different!)
   (f) timeutil.h (Microsoft MSVC, use the Windows time structures)
6. decentTree target is no longer built in utils folder
   (it isn't built at all.  I'll probably address this in a later commit).
7. Changes to files in the alignment folder are mostly needed because
   of functions moved out of utils/tools.cpp (see 4), especially
   safeGetLine().
8. Changes to files in the main folder are mostly about switching
   over std::vector<string> to StrVector (in a few places where that
   is now needed).
9. I corrected what looked like "stack overflow" bugs in 
   RateContinuousGamma (in the model folder).
10.Likewise, I made AliSimulator's destructor virtual (it wasn't!).
11.The top-most CMakeLists.txt, distancematrixtree (folder and lib) 
   are added, and USE_PROGRESS_DISPLAY is defined to 1.
